# 0x1A. Application server

An application server has a primary role in providing clients with access to a set of specific functions and features known as business logic. This business logic is responsible for generating dynamic content by processing and transforming data. The application server acts as a mediator that takes raw data and applies the necessary operations to provide the specialized functionality required by a business, service, or application.

In this project I'm adding an application server to my infrastructure and plugging it to my Nginx to make it serve the Airbnb clone project.
