# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

Computers and software rarely work the way we want. This project is a debugging series to train in the art of debugging which is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

For this project, a container is given that is to be used to solve the task. To solve this locally, I make use of docker
