# 0x0C. Web server

This project is aiming at training on automating tasks. If you can automate tasks that you do manually, you can then automate yourself out of repetitive tasks and focus your energy on something more interesting. For an SRE, that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. As the adage goes, "A good software engineer is a lazy software engineer"

Note that scripts are to be executes as root user.
