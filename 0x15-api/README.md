# 0x15. API

## Background Context
One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services that allow outsiders to interact with them â€“ access and modify their data. In this project, I access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a task that is not suited for Bash scripting. Python scripts are used instead
